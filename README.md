| Single Page Format         | - Display content on a single scrollable page without navigating between multiple pages<br> - Used this format with an intention to prevent distractions and effectively deliver concise but impactful content<br> - Divided into 4 sections: introduction, projects, work experience, and contact information |
| Smooth Navigation          | - Fixed top navbar for easy navigation between sections<br> - Scroll to top button for easy movement up and down the page                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Present Myself and My Work | - Fetch data with Supabase and display it as content<br> - Start by delivering my core values using concise headlines<br> - Showcase selected projects and work experience to prove my core values<br> - Provide a brief description, problem solving process, and skills used for each project                |
| Contact Information        | - On click, open visitorâ€™s email program to let them send an email without copying the email address<br> - Provide links to social media profiles for further contact                                                                                                                                          |

## Problem Solving Process

#### Building a Database to Enhance Efficiency

- Problem Identification : Low efficiency in managing data. Manually writing data directly in HTML made it difficult to manage and update data. Additionally, using a JSON file separated the data from the source code, but changes in the file were not reflected without a git commit
- Solution : Built a database with Supabase and implemented data fetching
- Outcome : Increased efficiency in data management and updates  
  &nbsp;

## Improvement Ideas

- Display a data loading indicator
- Implement more realistic error and confirmation messages
- Add a Korean language option for the website to reach more potential clients
